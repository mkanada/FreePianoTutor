# FreePianoTutor
A free opensource program that can be used to learn Piano/Keyboard.

By while, just a project. But in future, a free alternative to Piano Marvel, Pianu, Playground Sessions, etc.
Will work in Windows, Linux, Android, MacOS, iOS.

With a MIDI Keyboard, a Notebook/Computer/Tablet, anyone will be able to learn to play any music created by the community.

Development Plan
 - Create my first project in GODOT
 - Port Zenoage/Zont to GODOT
 - Add FluidSynth to project for all the platforms
 - Create modules for all platforms for MIDI input
 - Create a synthesia clone, but with MusicXML as input and a 'mid' file as accompaniment
 - Create program where can be easy to merge MusicXML and 'mid' files.
 -- Maybe, create a file format that merges MusicXML and mid.
 -- Maybe, port or incorporate MMA in the project.
